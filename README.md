## Overview

The Concrete Feedback Layers facilitate efficient CSI feedback by leveraging the Gumbel-softmax technique for continuous relaxation of binary feedback. The FBMU enables true variable-length bit-level feedback. Together, these components streamline the feedback process and optimize performance across various feedback lengths.
Furthermore, this repository introduces the Normalization-Free Knowledge Distillation (NF-KD) framework. This novel approach transfers the "Global Phase Map" from a high-capacity Teacher model to a variable-bit Student model without Z-score normalization, significantly improving structural restoration and NMSE performance in longer bit regimes.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ConcreteFeedbackLayers.git
cd ConcreteFeedbackLayers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the main script, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --config={config_name} --gpu={gpu_number}
```

## Configuration

All configurations for the experiments are housed in the `experiment_config.py` file located at `pytorch/configs/`. Below is a sample configuration for the O1_140 scenario.

### Sample Configuration for O1_140 Scenario

To run the NF-KD framework, use the newly added configuration which requires a pre-trained Teacher model checkpoint:
```python
def channeltransformer_nfkd_bit_variable():
    launcher = NF_KD_Launcher
    model = ChannelTransformerBitLevelLargeVariable
    trainer = NF_KD_Trainer
    data = DeepMIMOSampleDataset
    options = {
        'wandb_project_name': 'BitChannelTransformer_NFKD',
        'save_dir': '/home/automatic/projects/ConcreteFeedbackLayers/checkpoints/O1_140_NFKD/',
        # ... (data_options, model_options are same as baseline) ...
        
        # 🌟 NF-KD specific parameters 🌟
        'teacher_ckpt_path': '/home/automatic/projects/ConcreteFeedbackLayers/checkpoints/O1_140/TeacherModel_256.ckpt',
        'tau': 5.0,     # Temperature scaling for KLD
        'alpha': 0.3,   # Loss ensemble weight ratio (Task Loss vs. KD Loss)
        
        # ... (trainer_options, optimizer_options are same as baseline) ...
    }
    return [(launcher, model, trainer, data, options)]

```python
def channeltransformer_sgdr_bit_variable():
    launcher = BaseLauncher
    model = ChannelTransformerBitLevelLargeVariable
    trainer = SGDR_Bit_Variable_Trainer
    data = DeepMIMOSampleDataset

                'gamma': 0.8
            },
    }
    return [(launcher, model, trainer, data, options)]
```

## Running Experiments

To run experiments, specify the desired configuration name and GPU number in the command:

```bash
python main.py --config=channeltransformer_sgdr_bit_variable --gpu=0
```

Make sure the paths in the configuration file are correctly set to your dataset and checkpoint directories.

## Results

After running the experiments, checkpoints will be saved in the directory specified in the configuration file (`save_dir`).
Metrics during training and testing will be saved to WandB, in the project name provided in the configuration (`wandb_project_name`).

## Checkpoints

Pre-trained checkpoints for the O1_140 and O1_28B scenarios are provided in the `checkpoints/` directory at the project root. These checkpoints have been saved using `git-lfs` to manage large files. You can find the checkpoints in their respective subdirectories:

- `checkpoints/O1_140/`
- `checkpoints/O1_28B/`

To use these checkpoints, ensure you have `git-lfs` installed and initialized in your local repository. For more information on `git-lfs`, visit [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

These checkpoints can be loaded and used to continue training or for evaluation purposes as specified in the configuration files.
